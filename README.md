# Automated-Amazon-Price-Tracker

• Utilized BeautifulSoup to scrape the product price from Amazon’s page.
• Developed an email alert (SMTP module) to notify users when the product price drops below a preset value.
• Secured sensitive information by storing them in a .env file and using the os and dotenv modules to access them.
• Enhanced HTTP request headers with User-Agent and Accept-Language to facilitate live Amazon site scraping.
